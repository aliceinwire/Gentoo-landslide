so i was doing debian maintaining but many problem:
lack of support.
team already made.
no help and too much rules.
too much delay from package made and talk with sponsor developer.
some people said talking is bad because im taking their time.

my question is we want to make the distribution better and help new maintainer? or just complain and close supporting people out ?


first step
just use the distribution!

install gentoo!

is coder friendly!

made by developers for developers!

You like to code and dont want to take three hour loking at how to interact with other people and which consequense you have on the team.

There is many project that need help, and you see all the warning during compilation so you can choose from the software you are gonna to use more which one you what and witch ebuild or other things to fix.

all the package manager is made in python so is human friendly language and simple to understand

We use bugzilla, is really simple to use and follow the workflow (better to dont use gmail) because of no x-header filter

you learn a lot from the process, i think is one of the most good experience i got about programming and i hope that you also love to do it :)

dont mind about installation if is too difficult, you are learning and contribute also during installation fase!!!

use layman and make your own repository and patch :)
